# Soil erosion detection

repository consists of analysis notebook where i did data processing and divided data into train-test sets. In modeling notebook I've created UNet model and train it on data with different patch size and with a few loss functions. I've summed things up in solution report file. In addition I add all of my models and data acquired in this process in the data&models file. Also it is worth to mention that this task was made in google colab.
